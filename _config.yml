            <p class="text-left">Bootstrap Studio has a powerful feature called <strong>Preview.</strong> With it, you can open your design in multiple web browsers and devices, and every change you make within the app will be shown instantaneously everywhere.&nbsp;Here is
                how to start it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Hit the <strong>Preview</strong> button from the Main toolbar.&nbsp; </li>
                <li>In the dialog that is shown, hit <strong>Enable Preview</strong> and copy one of the URLs. </li>
                <li>Open this URL on the devices/browsers that you wish to test. This URL is only available in your local network and can't be seen from outside.&nbsp; </li>
            </ol>

            <figure><img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/img/preview dialog.png"></figure>
            <p class="text-left">Now you can experiment with a design and test it at the same time. No need to switch to a web browser and hit the refresh button, which is a great productivity increase. </p>
            <p class="text-left">In a team setting, Preview is a great tool for collecting feedback from colleagues.</p>

            <h2 class="text-uppercase text-center">Exporting </h2>
            <p class="text-left">Once you are happy with a design, you can export it into regular HTML+CSS. Just hit the <strong>Export</strong> button and choose a folder on your computer. Bootstrap Studio will generate a number of files which are a perfect representation
                of your design.</p>
            <figure><img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/img/export options.png"></figure>
            <p class="text-left">You can also choose to minify your JS and CSS, or to use CDN versions of jQuery, Bootstrap and the icon fonts for extra performance.</p>
            <p class="text-left">For the technically minded folks, there is also the option for configuring an <strong>Export Script</strong>. You point it to an <em>executable</em> file (can be a bash script, an exe program or anything else that can be run from a terminal),
                and it will be run whenever you export your design. You can use it for post processing the resulting code. The export destination path is passed as arg 1.</p>
            <p class="text-left">After you hit the Export button, Bootstrap Studio exports your design as clean and well-structured HTML. It looks as if a professional front end developer had written it by hand!</p>
